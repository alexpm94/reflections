What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder called .git is created, this is the repository, we can visualize it with ls -a. This Folder will contain specific files from git. 
We use the command git init. We need it to create our commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

In the working repository we can find the current version files.
In the repository we can find the commits so that we can check the old ones.
Staging area allow us to select a bunch of files to update in the same commit.
