How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

as we saw in the video, something simple like
a typo, can make a huge difference.
so if we changed the code by mistake, we can
find it quickley by using "diff".

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can acces to different versions of a file under the same
name. It's less confused to look at the right version. If we modify the file several times, it's convenient to save all the possible versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

As is subjective to choose the right moment, we could later
get confused if we did not commited at the right moment. We
could not create enough commits and then it will be a bit
harder to find a bug.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it could be a dependen change between them. Like to change the name of a variable.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

just type in the terminal git log, inside the directory, it shows
the commits, scroll down, and copy de name of the commits to
compare. git diff commit1 commit2 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would deffinetely use it for my final project. It's helpful to keep organized
as well as to have a copy on the cloud.

For sure!!
