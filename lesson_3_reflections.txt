When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever i am working on a collaboratif project. Where all the 
team could interact with the files.

To create a new repo in GitHub, we have to follow the next
steps:
1. Create a remote:  git remote add origin URL
2. Push the commits: git push origin master


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone generates the same content from a repository into another 
directory. This could be local or from GitHub to Local.
Forke clones from GitHub to GitHub.
Brnach could be local or in GitHub. It's goal is to work in a parallel process from a commit.
